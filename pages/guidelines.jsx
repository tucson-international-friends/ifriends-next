* Hosts and students are matched for one year, as long as it is mutually satisfying, with an obligation to get together a minimum of once a month.  Although the relationships may continue well beyond the year, we hope hosts will make themselves available to other first year students in subsequent years.

  * Academic problems with professors, advisors and administrators

  * Major medical problems

* School work and study are every student’s first priority.

* Become familiar with important holidays, and remember that the United States is comprised of people from many different cultures, races, religions, and ethnic groups.

* Share views on each other’s economic and political systems.  Talk about current news events, but do not pontificate or alienate.

* Cook a traditional meal for your host.  Ask if you can use your host’s kitchen if you do not have space.
